'''
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

            if complement in num_map:
                return [num_map[complement], i]
            num_map[num] = i  # Store index of the current number
        return []  # This line should never be reached as per problem constraints

# Example test cases
sol = Solution()
print(sol.twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
print(sol.twoSum([3, 2, 4], 6))       # Output: [1, 2]
print(sol.twoSum([3, 3], 6))          # Output: [0, 1]
